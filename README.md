# Structural Node Embedding in Signed Networks
This is a reference implementation for our structural node embedding methods for signed networks.  These can be used to learn features for individual nodes or entire graphs, when both positive and negative edges are present.  The features reflect the structural roles that the nodes play in the network.  

The code will be available soon.
