This is a reference implementation for our structural node embedding methods for signed networks, sNCE and sRDE, along with the signed graphlets kernel.  Code for obtaining graph-level features from node embeddings using RGM can be found at <a href="https://github.com/GemsLab/RGM">its original source</a>.

If you use our code, please cite our paper:
